C++ STL 
vector: dynamic array -- efficient at random access, and add/delete at end.
list : doubly-linked list -- efficient at forward/backward traversal, and insertion anywhere.
forward_list : singly-linked list -- efficient at forward traversal, and insertion anywhere.
deque : doubled ended queue -- dynamic array that also allows for efficient add/delete at beginning
array : static array -- size fixed at compile time.
